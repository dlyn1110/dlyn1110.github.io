For my first project I created a Happy Hour Gem, which allows users to find and get details of the most popular happy hour bars in Brooklyn. There are definitely steps to follow when building your projects. I did find the most effective way to go about this process is to draw/map out what you would like your interface to do.  Make sure you’re able to get it functioning the way you imagined it, then to scrape, then tweak!  

Watching Avi’s CLI gem videos are clutch, and utilize your 1:1’s!!! This support is key in gaining a second pair of eyes on your code, as well as learning how to navigate and drill down your code with ‘pry’ (which is a necessity and a delight!). 

Bottom-line is you’re going to run into blocks, but they are part of the process and absolutely necessary for your learning.  With all the mounted frustration and anxiety in the beginning and midway through this project, I found myself enjoying it and excited to move onto the next.
