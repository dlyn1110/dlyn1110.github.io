<p>A few months ago I decided to look at a piece of code and decipher what I was viewing.  I had zero background tech, and was merely looking because I was playing around on a Wordpress tutorial I had been following.  The more I asked the question of “why?” or, “how” it all works? the more I delved into tutorials on YouTube.  I wanted to more structure  and  more of a community to work with as I fed my curiosity. Flatiron seemed to be the right fit for this. 
<br />It is scary to be so new to anything, but am certain even on the days when I am ready to chuck my laptop out of the window, the curiosity and urge to understand and create with code with supersede all doubts and frustrations. Teaching patience and kindness to oneself is crucial for this process.  
<br />Looking forward to laughing at this introduction to my blog one day….
